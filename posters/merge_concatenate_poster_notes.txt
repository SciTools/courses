I created both the Merge and Concatenate posters using Inkscape. I have included the svg files used to make the poster in case anyone wants to edit it or base a new poster on it. Everything in the document is based on Inkscape's 3D boxes tool with Angles X, Y and Z set to (154.759, 90.000, 25.241). These angles can be adjusted but I'm not able to get a consistent result from this and it never really behaved the way I expected. 

The 3D boxes are actually 6 "flat" shapes that come together to resemble a 3D object. These flat shapes can be separated by clicking on a box and under the 'Object' tab selecting 'Ungroup'. The planes representing the coordinates are made using this methods, though usually from boxes with slightly different dimensions to those of the cubes.

The lines along the sides of the cubes are literally just lines. The red lines represent longitude, purple are latitude and green is height. I put these aroung the cubes to make it clear that these are in a sense "on the outside" of the cube data, that they're like a reference used to move around the outside and identify a particular point. These lines were then grouped together to make a "cage" for each layer. Note the blue "data" inside of the cages are actually 3 of the flat planes grouped togehter. Originally each layer was a 3D box, but for some reason sometimes when the boxes were moved or copied they simply vanished. Ungrouping a box and grouping then grouping it again seemed to resolve this issue.
