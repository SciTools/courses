    "The Python language is an excellent tool for general-purpose programming, with a highly readable syntax, rich and powerful data types (strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, arbitrary length integers, etc) and a very comprehensive standard library. It was not, however, designed specifically for mathematical and scientific computing. Neither the language nor its standard library have facilities for the efficient representation of multidimensional datasets, tools for linear algebra and general matrix manipulations (essential building blocks of virtually all scientific computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Python lists are very flexible containers that can be nested arbitrarily deep and can hold any Python object in them, but they are poorly suited to represent common mathematical constructs like vectors and matrices. It is for this reason that NumPy exists."

This broadcasting behavior is in practice enormously powerful, especially given that when NumPy broadcasts to create new dimensions or to 'stretch' existing ones, it doesn't actually duplicate the data. In the example above the operation is carried out as if the scalar 1.5 was a 1D array with 1.5 in all of its entries, but no actual array is ever created.
