    "## Course overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for Python. It allows dynamic scheduling of tasks for optimising computations and includes collections (extensions of arrays, lists and dataframes) for use with parallel data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Iris v2.0, dask has been integrated with Iris. This means you can utilise all of the benefits of dask while keeping the fileformat interoperability and other functionality that Iris provides."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "### Why does this course exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "This course exists to enable you to use dask and Iris together for more performant, memory efficient data processing by showing some useful patterns for combining dask and Iris.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iris/dask integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Iris uses dask to defer data loading and processing by default in a number of situations, including loading and some mathematical, analytical and statistical operations. This course will introduce some patterns for using Iris and dask together to produce your own bespoke data prcessing pipelines that meet your analytical needs while maintaining deferred data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "A real benefit of dask is parallel data processing by default. This means you will see existing Iris processing paradigms getting faster, and we will show patterns for loading and processing data to take advantage of dask parallel processing so that your bespoke processing pipelines will also run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Data volumes are getting larger and larger, and we are getting to the point where a typical dataset is now larger than the amount of system memory available to process the dataset with. In many cases then, we can no longer just load an entire dataset into memory and perform data processing on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask provides intelligent deferral of loading data from disk into memory (this is often referred to as [out-of-core processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm)). This dask functionality is available in Iris as well. This means that dask enables Iris to load and perform data processing on data volumes that are significantly larger than system memory available to you without blowing memory. This means data can also be processed faster and with less difficulty."

    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thread\n",
    "A thread is the simplest unit of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process\n",
    "A process is an isolated computation which consists of one or more threads. The threads within a process can be executed concurrently (simultaneously) and have access to the same resources within the process (memory, executable code and variable values). Processes cannot share these resources with other processes. Each process has its own individual address space, while the threads within that process share their address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph\n",
    "A way to represent 'things' and their relationships, where a node (circle) is a thing and an edge (line) between nodes is their relationship; e.g. a social network where nodes are people and edges are their friendships.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Dask architecture\n",
    "Below is the basic structure of how the components of dask interact:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/dask_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask uses a pool of workers to process tasks specified by the scheduler. The scheduler determines the tasks to be done by intelligently traversing the task graph. The task graph is produced dynamically and automatically passed to the scheduler when using dask functionality in your code. In the case of dask distributed, the task graph is submitted to the scheduler by the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduler\n",
    "One of dask’s key benefits is its ability to efficiently schedule tasks to optimize computations. Everything dask does is built on top of “schedulers”. These schedulers take the order of work established by a task graph and find the optimal way to break down and carry out the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask has four types of schedulers:\n",
    "- Synchronous: Single thread (good for debugging).\n",
    "        dask.get\n",
    "- Threaded: Utilises a thread pool.\n",
    "        dask.threaded.get\n",
    "- Multiprocessing: Utilises a process pool.\n",
    "        dask.multiprocessing.get\n",
    "- Distributed: Utilises a cluster of distributed machines.\n",
    "        distributed.Client.get\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worker\n",
    "A worker receives tasks to process from the scheduler and returns output to the scheduler when that processing is finished. A worker can be a thread, a process or a whole machine, depending on the scheduler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client\n",
    "A client provides the primary point of access to a distributed scheduler and its associated workers. When using a threaded or multiprocessing scheduler interation with the scheduler is handled by the collection or delayed object.\n"
