# Cartopy course, exercise 2

# Use 'set_global' to work out what it was actually doing earlier.

# Code as previously ...
proj = ccrs.EquidistantConic()
x0, y0 = -50, -30
x1, y1 = 10, 55

ax = plt.axes(projection=proj)
ax.coastlines()
plt.plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], linewidth=4)

# But now added 'set_global()'
ax.set_global()

plt.show()

#
# NOTE:
# Result is a tiny blue dot, close to lat=0, lon=0.
# Because on this map, the native "X" and "Y" coordinates are in **metres** from the origin.
